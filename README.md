## Module Project: Building a Research Assistant Tool with Next.js and Langchain

Imagine having a research assistant at your fingertips, one who can understand and provide insights from any PDF document you provide. This is not just a figment of imagination anymore; it's a reality we're going to build together using Next.js, Langchain, and vector databases like MemoryVectorStore and Pinecone.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
